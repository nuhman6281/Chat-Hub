# 🔍 WebRTC Call Issues - Debug Guide

## Issue Summary

Both users show "Audio Call Active" but cannot hear each other. The calls connect but media doesn't flow.

## 🧪 Immediate Debugging Steps

### 1. Open Browser Developer Console

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Make a test call between two users

### 2. Run Automatic Diagnostics

Once you're in an active call, run this in the console:

```javascript
// Run comprehensive diagnostics
WebRTCDebugger.runConnectionDiagnostics(null, null, null);

// Download debug report
WebRTCDebugger.downloadDebugReport();
```

### 3. Check Call Flow Logs

The new debugger will show detailed logs like:

- `🚀 Initiating audio call to user X`
- `📞 Generated call ID: call_X_Y_timestamp`
- `🎥 Requesting user media with constraints`
- `📋 Creating WebRTC offer...`
- `✅ Call initiated successfully via API`

### 4. Key Points to Check

#### On Caller Side:

- ✅ WebRTC offer created and sent with call initiation
- ✅ Local media stream obtained
- ✅ Peer connection established
- ⚠️ **Check:** Remote description set with answer

#### On Receiver Side:

- ✅ Incoming call received with WebRTC offer
- ✅ Local media stream obtained
- ✅ Remote description set with offer
- ✅ Answer created and sent
- ⚠️ **Check:** Connection establishment

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: WebRTC Answer Not Reaching Caller

**Symptoms:** Caller never gets answer from receiver
**Debug:** Look for "📋 Setting remote description (answer from receiver)" on caller side

### Issue 2: ICE Candidates Not Exchanging

**Symptoms:** Connection states stuck in "checking" or "new"
**Debug:** Look for "🧊 Generated ICE candidate" and "✅ Successfully added ICE candidate"

### Issue 3: Media Stream Issues

**Symptoms:** Connection established but no audio/video
**Debug:** Check track counts and states in stream debugging logs

## 🔧 Debug Commands

### Check Current Connection State

```javascript
// Get current call context (if available)
WebRTCDebugger.debugCallFlow(window.peerConnection);

// Check media streams
WebRTCDebugger.debugMediaStream(window.localStream, "Current Local");
WebRTCDebugger.debugMediaStream(window.remoteStream, "Current Remote");
```

### Monitor Real-time

```javascript
// Clear logs and start fresh
WebRTCDebugger.clearLogs();

// Make your call, then check logs
WebRTCDebugger.getLogs().forEach((log) => console.log(log));
```

## 📊 Expected Debug Output

### Successful Call Flow:

```
🚀 Initiating audio call to user 2
📞 Generated call ID: call_1_2_1234567890
🎥 Requesting user media with constraints: {...}
📺 Local (Caller) Stream Debug: {...}
🔗 Adding local stream tracks to peer connection
📋 Creating WebRTC offer...
📋 Created offer - setting as local description
✅ Call initiated successfully via API
📞 Call answered event received: {...}
📋 Setting remote description (answer from receiver)
✅ Successfully set remote description with answer
🧊 ICE connection state changed: connected
✅ ICE connection established - media should flow
```

## 🚨 Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: No Answer Received

```
✅ Call initiated successfully via API
⏰ Call timeout - no response from recipient
```

**Fix:** Check server-side answer forwarding

### Pattern 2: Answer Received But No Connection

```
📋 Setting remote description (answer from receiver)
✅ Successfully set remote description with answer
🧊 ICE connection state changed: failed
```

**Fix:** Check ICE candidate exchange

### Pattern 3: Connection But No Media

```
✅ ICE connection established - media should flow
❌ Remote: No stream available
```

**Fix:** Check track addition and remote stream handling

## 🎯 Next Steps Based on Logs

1. **Make a test call**
2. **Check console for debug output**
3. **Run `WebRTCDebugger.downloadDebugReport()`**
4. **Share the debug report to identify the exact failure point**

The comprehensive logging will show exactly where the WebRTC connection is failing!
