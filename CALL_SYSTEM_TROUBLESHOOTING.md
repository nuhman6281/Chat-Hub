## 🔧 **Enhanced Features & Recovery Mechanisms**

### **Connection State Monitoring**

- **Real-time Connection Status**: Live monitoring of ICE and WebRTC connection states
- **Visual Indicators**: Professional status display with icons and descriptions
- **Automatic Recovery**: Intelligent reconnection attempts for failed connections
- **Manual Recovery**: User-initiated recovery controls when automatic fails

### **Screen Sharing Fallback System**

- **Seamless Camera Transition**: Automatic fallback to camera when screen sharing stops
- **Media Stream Recreation**: Re-establish camera/audio streams if lost during transitions
- **User Notifications**: Clear feedback about video source changes
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of screen sharing failures

### **Advanced Error Handling**

- **ICE Connection Recovery**: Automatic ICE restart for failed connections
- **Media Stream Recovery**: Re-acquire camera/microphone on failures
- **Signaling State Validation**: Prevent duplicate offers/answers
- **Server-Side Validation**: Enhanced WebSocket error handling

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **1. Screen Sharing to Camera Fallback Issues**

**Problem**: Remote user sees blank screen when screen sharing stops

**Enhanced Solution**:

- ✅ **Automatic Stream Recreation**: System now recreates camera stream if missing
- ✅ **Graceful Track Replacement**: Seamless transition using `replaceTrack()`
- ✅ **Fallback Notifications**: Users informed about video source changes
- ✅ **Emergency Audio-Only**: Falls back to audio if camera unavailable

**Recovery Steps**:

1. **Automatic**: System attempts camera recovery automatically
2. **Manual Recovery**: Use "Reset Audio & Video" from recovery dropdown
3. **Selective Recovery**: "Reset Video Only" if audio works
4. **Emergency**: "Reconnect Call" for complete ICE restart

### **2. Connection Failures & Recovery**

**Problem**: Call quality degrades or connection fails

**Enhanced Solution**:

- ✅ **ICE State Monitoring**: Real-time connection quality tracking
- ✅ **Automatic ICE Restart**: Triggered after 3 seconds of disconnection
- ✅ **Recovery UI**: Visible recovery controls when issues detected
- ✅ **Progressive Fallback**: Audio-only mode if video fails

**Recovery Mechanisms**:

```
Connection Failed → Auto ICE Restart → Manual Recovery → Call Restart
      ↓                    ↓                 ↓             ↓
   3 seconds         Recovery Offer    User Controls   Last Resort
```

### **3. Media Device Issues**

**Problem**: Camera/microphone suddenly stops working

**Enhanced Solution**:

- ✅ **Device Loss Detection**: Monitor track `onended` events
- ✅ **Permission Recovery**: Re-request permissions if needed
- ✅ **Constraint Adaptation**: Fallback to available devices
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery guidance

## 🔍 **Connection Status Indicators**

### **Status Types**

- 🟢 **Connected**: High-quality connection established
- 🟡 **Connecting**: Initial connection setup
- 🟠 **Reconnecting**: Attempting to restore connection
- 🔴 **Failed**: Connection lost, recovery needed
- ⚫ **Disconnected**: No active connection

### **Recovery Controls**

Available when connection issues detected:

- **Reconnect Call**: Full ICE restart with new offer/answer
- **Reset Audio & Video**: Re-acquire both media streams
- **Reset Video Only**: Camera stream only
- **Reset Audio Only**: Microphone stream only

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Screen Sharing Fallback**

```typescript
// Enhanced stopScreenShare with comprehensive fallback
1. Stop screen share tracks
2. Check for existing camera stream
3. Recreate camera stream if missing
4. Replace tracks in peer connection
5. Notify remote user with fallback status
6. Provide user feedback about transition
```

### **Connection Recovery**

```typescript
// ICE connection recovery process
1. Detect connection failure
2. Create ICE restart offer
3. Send recovery offer to remote
4. Process recovery answer
5. Re-establish media tracks
6. Update connection status
```

### **Media Stream Recovery**

```typescript
// Media stream recovery for lost devices
1. Detect media track ended
2. Re-request user media
3. Replace tracks in peer connection
4. Update UI state
5. Notify user of recovery status
```

## 📊 **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Console Logging**

Enhanced logging system provides detailed insights:

- `🔄` Connection recovery attempts
- `✅` Successful operations
- `❌` Errors and failures
- `⚠️` Warnings and fallbacks
- `🖥️` Screen sharing events
- `🎥` Video stream changes

### **Development Mode**

Additional debugging information available:

- ICE connection state in status display
- Detailed WebRTC state transitions
- Media stream track monitoring
- Recovery attempt logging

## 🎯 **Best Practices for Users**

### **For Optimal Call Quality**:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Required for screen sharing and device access
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow camera/microphone access
3. **Stable Network**: Ensure good internet connectivity
4. **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest versions)
5. **Close Other Apps**: Reduce system resource usage

### **When Issues Occur**:

1. **Check Status**: Monitor connection status indicator
2. **Use Recovery**: Try automated recovery first
3. **Manual Recovery**: Use dropdown recovery options
4. **Restart Call**: Last resort for persistent issues
5. **Check Settings**: Verify device permissions
